## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the famous **Titanic dataset** to explore the factors that influenced passenger survival.  
We use **Python**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.  

The notebook is designed for **Google Colab** — no setup required!

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Seaborn Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/titanic.csv) *(or local CSV file)*
- Features include:
  - `survived` – Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
  - `pclass` – Ticket class
  - `sex` – Gender
  - `age` – Passenger age
  - `sibsp` – Siblings/spouses aboard
  - `parch` – Parents/children aboard
  - `fare` – Ticket fare
  - `embarked` – Port of embarkation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3** – Programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data handling  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Label encoding and preprocessing  

---

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning (handling missing values)  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Survival rate analysis by:
  - Gender  
  - Passenger class  
  - Age groups  
- Visualizations: bar plots, histograms, heatmaps

## ▶️ Run the Notebook
Open directly in **Google Colab**:  

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Thanmai847/growfinix-titanic-analysis/blob/main/Titanic-analysis.ipynb)

---

## 📌 Results Summary
- **Women** had a much higher survival rate than men.  
- **First-class passengers** were more likely to survive.  
- Younger passengers had a better chance of survival.  

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Build a **machine learning model** to predict survival  
- Perform **feature engineering** for better insights  
- Add **interactive visualizations** using Plotly
